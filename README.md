# Jeeves

A bot for Discord based on the Discord4J library.

Through a number of modules Jeeves has a certain focus on the game Elite: Dangerous, but can also provide useful functions for Discord servers unrelated to the game.

For Elite: Dangerous related Discord servers it offers access to the EDSM and ED Materializer APIs.
Jeeves' more general functions include things welcoming new users, handling of roles or announcements of streams.

This is the second incarnation of Jeeves, with the first one (https://github.com/unrealization/FGEBot) being a fork of the FGEBot (https://github.com/JBHemloque/FGEBot), written in JavaScript.
